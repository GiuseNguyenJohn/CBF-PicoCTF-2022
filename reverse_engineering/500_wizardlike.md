Author: John and David
## Description
Do you seek your destiny in these deplorable dungeons? If so, you may want to look elsewhere. Many have gone before you and honestly, they've cleared out the place of all monsters, ne'erdowells, bandits and every other sort of evil foe. The dungeons themselves have seen better days too. There's a lot of missing floors and key passages blocked off. You'd have to be a real wizard to make any progress in this sorry excuse for a dungeon!
