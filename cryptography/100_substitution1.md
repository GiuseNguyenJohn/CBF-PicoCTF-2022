## Solution

Use an online substitution cipher solver to break the cipher. Here's the one that was used for this writeup:
[Guballa Substitution Solver](https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver)

Of course, these aren't perfect every time. This returned the flag "picoCTF{FR3JU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_3645BEC6}", because the algorithm mapped V to J, but that can be easily fixed because we can make out most of the text now.

**Flag: picoCTF{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_3645BEC6}**
