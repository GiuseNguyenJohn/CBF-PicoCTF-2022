## Description

It seems that another encrypted message has been intercepted. The encryptor seems to have learned their lesson though and now there isn't any punctuation! Can you still crack the cipher?

## Solution

The goal of this challenge is to not rely on spacing, capitalization, and punctuation to be able to make out words. In other words, use bigram analysis to analyze pairs of letters, and compare frequency to letter pairs to statistical letter frequencies in the English language.

Just use the same substitution cipher though...
