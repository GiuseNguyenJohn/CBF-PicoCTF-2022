# Roboto Sans
Author: John
## Description
The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.
Check this out.

## Solution
The challenge name sounds similar to "robot", which is probably a reference
to `robots.txt`, which is a common theme for easy web CTF challenges.
Let's go to that file.
```
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
Disallow: /wp-admin/
```
Interesting, we know we are on the right track. There is some base64 text at
the bottom, and when we decode them in CyberChef we see that the lines don't
make sense, except for the line with `anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==`, which decodes
to `js/myfile.txt`. Visiting that, we get the flag.
