## Description
We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?
The website is running here.

## Solution
From the challenge description, we can immediately guess that there are hidden
folders/directories that we have to discover. The hint confirms this:

> folders folders folders

So, let's bruteforce directories with `gobuster`.
```
gobuster dir -t 100 -u http://<host>:<port>/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/
```
- `-t`: threads (I used 100)
- `-u`: url
- `-w`: path to wordlist
