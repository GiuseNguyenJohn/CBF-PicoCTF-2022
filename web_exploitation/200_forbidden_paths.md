# Forbidden Paths

## Description
Can you get the flag?
Here's the website.
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

## Solution
The challenge description alludes to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
The website allows us to read files on the filesystem, but we cannot use absolute file paths.
So, we can use relative file paths instead. Since we know the flag file is four directories back
(from the description), we can use the payload `../../../../flag.txt` and read the flag.
