# Power Cookie
Author: John

## Description
Can you get the flag? Go to this website and see what you can discover.

## Solution

From the challenge name, we can infer that we have to modify a cookie
to solve the challenge. When we visit the page, there is a `Continue as guest`
button, which we click. The page that appears after that reveals nothing, but
when we use the inspect tool and view the data stored on our computer, we see
a cookie called `isAdmin` set to `0`. Is Admin? Don't mind if we do, let's 
change the value to `1` so that it evaluates to true. Once we do that and 
reload the page, we get the flag.
