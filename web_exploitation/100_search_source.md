## Description
The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it?
The website is here

## Solution
The hint says:
> How could you mirror the website on your local machine so you could use more powerful tools for searching?

So after googling `mirror website locally`, we find that we can download the source code of the entire website with `wget -m <url>`. After this, it's just a matter of grepping through the files for the flag.
```
$ grep -r "picoCTF" saturn.picoctf.net:64200 
saturn.picoctf.net:64200/css/style.css:/** banner_main picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_3003ba70} **/
```

**Flag: picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_3003ba70}**
