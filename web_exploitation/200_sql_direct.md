# SQL Direct
Author: John
## Description
Connect to this PostgreSQL server and find the flag!
psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 57884 -U postgres pico
Password is postgres

## Solution

First, do some research. We need some commands to be able to interact with
a postgres sql server. I found the command `\d` to list all tables.
Connect with the command in the description:
```
pico-# SELECT 
pico-# \d
         List of relations
 Schema | Name  | Type  |  Owner   
--------+-------+-------+----------
 public | flags | table | postgres
(1 row)
```
Then, from my previous background knowledge of SQL, I knew that I could
dump information from a table with the SQL query `SELECT * FROM \<table\>.
```
pico=# SELECT * FROM flags;
 id | firstname | lastname  |                address                 
----+-----------+-----------+----------------------------------------
  1 | Luke      | Skywalker | picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_a26695df}
  2 | Leia      | Organa    | Alderaan
  3 | Han       | Solo      | Corellia
```
There we go!

Flag: picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_a26695df}
