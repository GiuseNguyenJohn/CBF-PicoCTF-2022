# Torrent Analyze

Author: David

## Description

SOS, someone is torrenting on our network.
One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like `picoCTF{filename}`.

## Solution

Open the file in Wireshark. As suggested by the challenge hint, go to "Analyze" > "Enabled Protocols" and enable all BT or BitTorrent protocols that aren't already enabled.

This writeup addresses only what is needed to obtain the flag. For a more thorough understanding of how torrent traffic is analyzed and examined, view this webpage that I came across in my research:
[Examining Torrent Traffic](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2013/09/14/index.html)

To find the name of the file that was torrented over the network, we need to know the hash of the file. We can find that in Wireshark.

The filter `bittorrent.info_hash` did not work, so I resorted to searching for "info_hash" in the packet details. To do this, press Ctrl+F, set the first field to "Packet details," the second field to "Narrow & Wide", turn case sensitive off, and set the last field to "String".

In Wireshark's folder structure for packet details, the info hash can be found in "BitTorrent DHT Protocol" > "Request arguments" > "Value" > "info_hash".

From packet 51080 onward, the info hash is "e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e".

The first Google search result yields this file name: "ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso"

And we'll wrap that in flag format to get the flag.


**Flag: picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}**
